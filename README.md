# HNG Stage 0: Dynamic Profile API

This project is a simple RESTful API created for the HNGi13 Internship Stage 0 task.
It exposes an endpoint that returns a static user profile along with two dynamic pieces of data: the current UTC time and a random cat fact fetched from an external API.

## Live API

The API is hosted on Railway and is accessible at the following endpoints:

- **Base URL:** [`https://sherifibrahim-profile-api.up.railway.app/`](https://sherifibrahim-profile-api.up.railway.app/)
- **Profile Endpoint:** [`https://sherifibrahim-profile-api.up.railway.app/me`](https://sherifibrahim-profile-api.up.railway.app/me)

## Features

- **Profile Information:** Returns JSON data with my profile information.
- **Cat Fact Integration:** Fetches a new random cat fact from the [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/) on every request.
- **Dynamic Timestamp:** Includes the current UTC time (ISO 8601) with each response.
- **Rate Limiting:** Basic protection against abuse, limiting requests to 10 per minute per IP.
- **CORS Enabled:** Configured to be accessible from any origin.
- **Type-Safe:** Written in TypeScript for robust and maintainable code.

## API Endpoints

### `GET /`

Returns a welcome message and lists available endpoints.

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "My HNG Stage 0 API is running!",
  "endpoints": {
    "profile": "/me"
  }
}
```

### `GET /me`

Returns the main profile data.

**Example Success Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "user": {
    "email": "ibrahimsherifdeji@gmail.com",
    "name": "Ibrahim Sherif Deji",
    "stack": "Node.js/Express/TypeScript/PostgreSQL/Prisma"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-17T10:00:00.000Z",
  "fact": "A cat can‚Äôt climb head first down a tree because its claws are all curved the same way."
}
```

**Example Error Response (if Cat Facts API fails):**

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Could not fetch a cat fact at this time"
}
```

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file, then fill in your details.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add your personal information.

### Running the Application

- **For development (with auto-reloading):**

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

  The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

- **For production:**
  First, build the TypeScript code into JavaScript:
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
  Then, start the server:
  ```sh
  npm run start
  ```

## Dependencies
